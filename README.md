## Overview:
Various different techniques and examples for generating random numbers from specific distriubtions on MATLAB.

## Contents:
- `Acceptance Rejection method`
- `Box-Muller method` (_Normally distributed_)
- `Fibonacci method`
- `Marsaglia method` (_Normally distributed_)
- `Linear Congruential Generator`

## Note:
Dear reader,

One topic that has come up time and time again during my learning is generating specific random numbers. It is a useful technique to understand how computers go about generating the random numbers they do, be that on MATLAB, Python, or even MS Excel. That being said, however, it __strongly__ recommended that you do not implement your own random number generator in your work unless the task explicitly asks for it. Instead you should always look to use the in-built functions as they will be far more robust and, in general, create a much longer non-repeating sequence. Truly random numbers cannot be generated computationally (yet) and as such the majority of methods rely on a _seed_ number. 

The scripts may not be perfect, but I hope these give you some insight.
